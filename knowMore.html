    <h2 class="km">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h2>
    <p class="hilight">HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of a web page. It
      stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is essential for creating documents on the World Wide Web. HTML provides
      a set of elements or tags that define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images,
      lists, and more. These elements are represented by opening and closing tags, enclosing the content to be displayed
      on the web page.
      HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it is used to structure content rather than to
      create functionality. It is complemented by other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and
      layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity.
      <br>
      HTML Boilerplate:
      An HTML boilerplate is a standardized template or starting point for creating HTML documents. It is a set of code
      that includes the basic structure and essential elements needed for any web page. The HTML boilerplate serves as a
      foundation that developers can build upon when creating a new web page, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the
      development process.
    </p>
    <h2 class="km">CSS</h2>
    <p class="hilight">
      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a
      document written in markup languages like HTML or XML. The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the order of priority
      that styles are applied when multiple conflicting style rules are present. CSS allows web developers and designers
      to control the layout, appearance, and visual presentation of web pages.
      Selectors: CSS selectors are patterns that define which elements in an HTML document the style rules should apply
      to. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and relationships with other
      elements.
      Properties and Values: CSS properties are attributes that define various style aspects such as color, font size,
      margin, padding, and more. Each property is assigned a value, determining the specific styling.

      Selectors and Declarations Combine to Form Rules: CSS rules consist of selectors and their corresponding
      declaration blocks. These rules specify how the selected elements should be styled.
      External, Internal, and Inline CSS.

    <h2 class="km">Javascript</h2>
    <p class="hilight">

      JavaScript:

      JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily known for its ability to enhance
      interactivity in web browsers. Developed by Netscape, it has become an essential technology for front-end web
      development and is also used on the server side (Node.js) and in various other contexts beyond web browsers.

      Key Concepts in JavaScript:

      Dynamic Scripting Language: JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted scripting language, meaning it can be executed
      line by line without the need for a compilation step. This flexibility makes it well-suited for web development.

      Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is mainly employed as a client-side scripting language, enabling developers to
      create dynamic and interactive user interfaces within web browsers. It can manipulate the Document Object Model
      (DOM), allowing real-time updates to the content and structure of a web page.

      Variables and Data Types: JavaScript uses variables to store and manage data. Variables can hold different data
      types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and more. Dynamic typing allows variables to change data
      types during runtime.
      Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be defined and called to perform a specific task.
      Functions can take parameters and return values, facilitating modular and organized code.
      JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years, and its ecosystem includes libraries and frameworks like
      React, Angular, and Vue.js for building robust and efficient web applications. With the advent of Node.js,
      JavaScript is now used on the server side as well, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.

    <h2 class="km">Bootstrap</h2>
    <p class="hilight">
      Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework developed by Twitter. It is a collection of HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript components and tools designed to simplify the process of building responsive and visually appealing web
      pages and web applications. Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed components and styles that developers can
      easily incorporate into their projects, saving time and ensuring a consistent look and feel across different
      devices and browsers.

      Key Features of Bootstrap:

      Responsive Grid System: Bootstrap utilizes a responsive grid system that automatically adjusts the layout of the
      page based on the screen size. This grid system makes it easy to create responsive designs that work well on
      various devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones.

      Pre-styled Components: Bootstrap comes with a rich set of pre-styled components such as navigation bars, buttons,
      forms, alerts, modals, carousels, and more. These components are customizable and can be easily integrated into
      projects with minimal effort.

      Typography and Styling: Bootstrap includes a set of default styles for typography, including headings, paragraphs,
      and lists. It also provides a responsive and flexible set of utility classes for styling elements.

      JavaScript Plugins: Bootstrap includes several JavaScript plugins that enhance the functionality of web pages.
      Examples include a carousel for image sliders, modal dialogs for displaying pop-up content, and a collapsible
      navigation menu.

    <h2 class="km">React JS</h2>
    <p class="hilight">
      React.js, commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building
      user interfaces (UIs) and single-page applications. React is often used in conjunction with other libraries and
      frameworks, forming the foundation for the development of modern and dynamic web applications.

      Key Concepts in React:

      Component-Based Architecture: React is based on a component-based architecture, where UIs are built using
      independent and reusable components. Components encapsulate the structure, behavior, and styling of a part of the
      user interface. This modular approach makes code organization more manageable and facilitates code reuse.

      Virtual DOM (Document Object Model): React introduces the concept of a Virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the
      actual DOM. When changes occur in the application, React first updates the Virtual DOM and then efficiently
      calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM. This approach improves performance by
      reducing the number of direct manipulations on the actual DOM.

      JSX (JavaScript XML): React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles XML or HTML. JSX allows
      developers to write UI components using a syntax that looks similar to HTML, making the code more readable. JSX is
      transpiled to regular JavaScript before being executed in the browser.
      Uni-directional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning that data flows in one directionâ€”from
      parent components to child components. This helps in maintaining a clear and predictable data flow, making it
      easier to debug and understand how data changes propagate through the application.

      State and Props: React components can have two types of data: state and props. State represents the internal state
      of a component, which can change over time, triggering re-renders. Props (short for properties) are passed from
      parent components to child components and are immutable.

      Lifecycle Methods: React components have lifecycle methods that are called at various points in the component's
      existence, such as when it is first mounted, updated, or unmounted. Developers can use these methods to perform
      actions like fetching data, updating the UI, or cleaning up resources.

      React Router: For building single-page applications with multiple views, React Router is often used. It enables
      navigation and rendering of different components based on the URL, providing a seamless user experience.

      Flux and Redux: React can be combined with state management libraries like Flux and Redux to manage the
      application's state in a predictable and centralized way. These libraries help handle complex data flows and
      ensure a consistent state across the application.
